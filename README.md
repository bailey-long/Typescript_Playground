Testing typescript and documenting notes as I learn

## Typescript
Typescript is a more precise and less error prone version of javascript, it has all the features contained in javascript but is written in a more type safe way. Typescript uses a "static checking" style of error handling where it tells you errors as you write instead of as you run the code.  
The typescript code will be compiled into javascript when you are ready to run the code.
